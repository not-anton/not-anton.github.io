# Story Expedition Backend

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
   The server will run in-memory and all data will be lost on restart.

## Deployment

- Deploy to a free Node.js host (e.g., Render, Fly.io, Railway, Glitch, etc.).
- Make sure to allow CORS for your GitHub Pages frontend domain.

## Configuration

- The frontend will need the backend URL to connect via Socket.IO.
